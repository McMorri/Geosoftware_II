  author = {Burrough, Peter A. and Mcdonnell, Rachael A.},
  month = mar,
  abstract = {{This book is a completely new version of the highly successful Principles
	of Geographical Information Systems for Land Resources Assessment
	which was first published in 1986. GIS are not just used for electronic
	map-making but today are major tools for the management of our physical
	and social environment. GIS are used to assist political decisions
	and play a part in market research, in the management of utility
	services, in automated navigation systems and in many other fields.
	This book presents a strong theoretical basis for GIS, which is often
	lacking in other texts. Spatial data are usually based on two, dichotomous
	paradigms, exactly defined entities in space, such as land parcels,
	or the continuous variation of single attributes, such as temperature
	or rainfall. Methods for modelling both kinds of phenomena and storing
	them in spatial databases are described in detail, including the
	use of geostatistics for interpolating from points to continuous
	fields. Examples of how spatial data and an analysis of their spatial
	interactions are used to solve a wide range of practical problems
	ranging from site-location analysis through land degradation, the
	optimizing of timber extraction from forests and the redistribution
	of Chernobyl radioactivity by floods are explained clearly and in
	detail. Much attention is paid to the problems of data quality and
	how statistical errors in spatial data can affect the results of
	spatial modelling based on the two paradigms of space. Fuzzy logic
	and continuous classification methods are presented as methods for
	linking the two spatial paradigms. The book concludes with an investigation
	of current developments in providing spatial data for the whole world
	over the Internet. As such the new volume provides a comprehensive
	and concise introduction to the theory and practice of Geographical
	Information Systems (GIS). Targeted at undergraduates, graduates,
	and professionals in disciplines such as physical and human geography,
	hydrology, geology, environmental science, cartography, epidemiology,
	radioecology, agriculture, spatial planning, land tenure, and land
	evaluation the book explains why spatial data and the information
	systems based on them are important in the modern world.}},

	to different kinds of inferential statements and different conclusions
	about statistical models and questions, so there are different theories
	of measurement, which in turn may lead to different kinds of statistical
	model and possibly different conclusions. This has led to much confusion
	and a long running debate about when different classes of statistical
	methods may legitimately be applied. This paper outlines the major
	theories of measurement and their relationships and describes the
	different kinds of models and hypotheses which may be formulated
	within each theory. One general conclusion is that the domains of
	applicability of the two major theories are typically different,
	and it is this which helps apparent contradictions to be avoided
	in most practical applications.},
